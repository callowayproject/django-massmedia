New in 0.8
==========

* New settings format
	All settings are contained within ``MASSMEDIA_SETTINGS``\ , ``MASSMEDIA_STORAGE``\ , and ``MASSMEDIA_UPLOAD_TO``\ . Old settings will work, but will raise a deprecation warning.

* New settings
	``MASSMEDIA_SETTINGS["USE_TAGGING"]`` and ``MASSMEDIA_SERVICES["YOUTUBE"]``

* Support for YouTube feeds as collections

Optional Requirements:
	django-tagging

Optional, but used for extracting Metadata:
	IPTCInfo
	hachoir-core
	hachoir-metadata
	hachoir-parser


To start using the app, place it in your INSTALLED_APPS. You may want to edit the settings.py file in the massmedia directory and adjust a few things. If you want to gather metadata, you should install the hachoir lib available at http://hachoir.org/. All in all, you will need the hachoir core,parser, and metadata packages installed.

To customize the app, try editing some of the templates. Media items are templated with the show_media tag using templates based on the media's mimetype.
